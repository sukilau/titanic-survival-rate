## Predict Survival on the Titanic (Kaggle Project)

This is my submission on a kickstart project to Kaggle. The problem is to predict the survival rate of passengers on the Titanic given a training set with the following attributes : 

survival : Survival	(0 = No, 1 = Yes) <br>
pclass : Ticket class	(1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd) <br>
sex	: Sex	 <br>
Age	: Age in years	 <br>
sibsp	: # of siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic	 <br>
parch	: # of parents / children aboard the Titanic	 <br>
ticket	: Ticket number	 <br>
fare	: Passenger fare	 <br>
cabin	: Cabin number	 <br>
embarked	: Port of Embarkation <br>

Random Forrest is used in making prediction on the test set.
